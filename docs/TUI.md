# Battery Logger TUI

The Battery Logger TUI provides real-time visualization of your battery data with intelligent discharge prediction.

## Usage

```bash
./battery-logger tui [options]
```

## Options

- `-window duration`: Time window to display and analyze (default: 10h)
  - Examples: `10m`, `30m`, `1h`, `2h`, `4h`, `6h`, `10h`
  - Can be changed in real-time via input field
- `-alpha float`: Exponential decay factor for weighted regression (default: 0.05)
  - Higher values give more weight to recent data points
  - Lower values consider historical data more equally
  - Can be changed in real-time via input field
- **Refresh rate**: Fixed at 10 seconds.

## Features

### ‚å®Ô∏è Controls
- **q** or **Q**: Quit the application
- **r** or **R**: Force refresh display
- **Tab**: Focus next input field
- **Shift+Tab**: Focus previous input field
- **Enter**: Apply changes in input fields (auto-refreshes data)
- **‚Üë/‚Üì**: Scroll info panel up/down
- **Mouse wheel**: Zoom in/out on chart (up to zoom in, down to zoom out)
- **Window resize**: Automatically adjusts layout

## Examples

### Basic usage with default settings
```bash
./battery-logger tui
```

### Focus on recent data with custom settings
```bash
./battery-logger tui -window 30m -alpha 0.1
```

### Long-term analysis with more historical weight
```bash
./battery-logger tui -window 4h -alpha 0.02
```

### High-frequency monitoring
```bash
./battery-logger tui -window 1h -alpha 0.1
```

## Understanding the Predictions

The TUI uses **weighted linear regression** to predict battery discharge and charging:

1. **Only the most recent contiguous session** is used for prediction (unplugged for discharge, plugged for charging)
2. **Recent data points** have higher weight in the calculation (exponential decay)
3. **Alpha parameter** controls how quickly weights decay over time
4. **Time-to-empty** is calculated using current battery level and discharge rate
5. **Time-to-full** uses the configured maximum charge target (`max_charge_percent` from config)
6. **Transition tracking** identifies when current AC status started

### Algorithm Details
- **Contiguous session analysis**: Walks backward from latest data to find the most recent uninterrupted session (unplugged or plugged)
- **Weighted regression**: Recent samples get exponentially higher weights based on alpha parameter
- **Real-time prediction**: Uses actual current battery level, not regression intercept
- **Configurable charge target**: Time-to-full predictions respect the `max_charge_percent` configuration (e.g., 80% instead of 100%)
- **Status transitions**: Tracks AC plug/unplug events with timestamps and battery levels

### Prediction Accuracy
- **More reliable** with longer contiguous sessions (‚â•2 samples required for either charging or discharging)
- **Most accurate** during consistent battery usage or charging patterns
- **Less reliable** immediately after AC transitions
- **Best results** with steady discharge/charge rates and sufficient session data
- **Charge predictions** depend on configured maximum charge target and charging behavior

## Troubleshooting

### "No recent data in window"
- Increase the `-window` parameter (try `-window 12h` or `-window 1d`)
- Check if battery-logger service is running: `systemctl --user status battery-logger`
- Verify data file exists: `~/.local/state/battery-logger/battery.csv`
- Ensure battery-logger has been collecting data for some time

### "Need ‚â•2 charging/discharging samples"
- Wait for more data points to be collected in the current session (charging or discharging)
- Increase the `-window` to include more historical data
- Check if you've had recent sessions longer than the sampling interval
- Verify the service is actively logging during both plugged and unplugged periods
- For charging predictions: ensure you have sufficient charging session data
- For discharge predictions: ensure you have sufficient unplugged session data

### "‚àû (not discharging or charging)" or poor predictions
- This appears when discharge rate is near zero or positive
- Ensure you're actually using the battery (not idle/suspended)
- Try adjusting `-alpha` parameter (range: 0.02-0.1)
- Wait for more consistent battery usage patterns
- Check if power management is affecting discharge rates
